## ⚠️ Spotify API Login Limitation:
In development mode, only Spotify users explicitly registered as collaborators in your Spotify developer dashboard can authenticate and log in through this app.
To allow broader access (e.g., for the public or demo users), you must request production access from Spotify for your application.
